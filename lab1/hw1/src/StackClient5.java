/*
StackClient5:  Write a stack transformation algorithm that starts with a stack containing n integers and finishes
with the same integers in the same stack, but with the value that has the minimum value moved to the top,
and all other values in the same order.  For example: if the initial stack is [7, 3, 1, 9, 6, 8]  then after
transformation the stack is [7, 3,  9, 6, 8, 1]. Hint: you may use another helper stack in your transformation algorithm.
